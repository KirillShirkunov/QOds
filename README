QOds is a free Qt5 (C++11) library to read/write .ods (OpenDocument
Spreadsheet) files.

See "how_to_build.html" for how to build for Windows
with MinGW or Visual Studio 2013.

Results tested on MS Office 2013 and LibreOffice.

For a simple tutorial check the code in app/main.cpp which also shows
how to create a sample invoice with formulas and (png) logos.

The resulting sample invoice file created programmatically with QOds
can be viewed at "app/Invoice.ods".
