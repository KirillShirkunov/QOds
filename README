QOds is a free Qt5/C++11 library to work with .ods (OpenDocument
Spreadsheet) files.

Features:
- Create and fill in .ods files with data, including formulas.
- Read .ods files, can also calculate the value of formulas.
- NO EDITING of .ods files supported, no plans, patches welcome.

See "how_to_build.html" for how to build for Windows
with MinGW or Visual Studio 2013.

Results tested on MS Office 2013 and LibreOffice.

For a simple tutorial check the code in app/main.cpp which also shows
how to create a sample invoice with formulas and image logos.

The resulting invoice file created programmatically with QOds can
be viewed at "app/Invoice.ods".
