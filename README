QOds is a free Qt5 (C++11) library to read/write .ods (OpenDocument
Spreadsheet) files.

Results tested on MS Office 2013, LibreOffice, and Calligra Sheets.

For a simple tutorial check the code in app/main.cpp which also shows
how to create a sample invoice with formulas and (png) logos.

The resulting sample invoice file created programmatically with QOds
can be viewed in the "app" subfolder, it's called "Invoice.ods".
